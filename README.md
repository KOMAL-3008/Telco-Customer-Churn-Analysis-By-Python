# Telco Customer Churn Analysis Readme

üìñ About the Project

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies. This project analyzes churn patterns in telecom customers using Python, aiming to answer a key question: Why do some customers leave while others stay? By exploring a dataset of over 7,000 customers, the analysis uncovers actionable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and pain points.

Whether you are a data enthusiast or a decision-maker, this project bridges the gap between data and strategy, offering visual and statistical clarity to improve customer retention.

üß© Problem Statement

Churn‚Äîwhen customers stop doing business with a company‚Äîhas significant financial implications. Through this project, the objective is to:

Identify patterns driving customer churn.

Highlight services, demographics, or behaviors that correlate with retention or departure.

Provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn.

üîç Insights from the Analysis

Who is Churning and Why?

1. Short-Term Customers:

Customers with a tenure of 1‚Äì2 months are highly likely to churn.

Loyalty grows with time‚Äîlonger-tenure customers tend to stay.

2. Senior Citizens:

Senior citizens churn at a higher rate compared to younger customers, possibly requiring specialized plans or support.

3. Contract Types:

Month-to-month contracts have significantly higher churn rates compared to one- or two-year contracts.

4. Payment Methods:

Customers using electronic checks exhibit higher churn. Transitioning them to automated or credit card payments could help.

5. Service Usage:

Churn is higher among customers who:

Do not use essential services like OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, or StreamingTV.

Opt for fewer bundled services.

üìä Visual Highlights

The project uses impactful visualizations to illustrate churn trends:

Pie Chart: 26.54% of customers churned, revealing the need for intervention.

Bar Charts:

Gender-wise and contract-based churn analysis.

Service usage patterns and their correlation with churn.


Histograms: Show tenure-based customer loyalty trends.

Stacked Bar Charts: Highlight the higher churn rate among senior citizens.


These visuals not only simplify complex data but also drive home key messages for stakeholders.

üöÄ How to Use the Project

1. Prerequisites:

Install Python (3.8 or later recommended).

Install the necessary libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

2. Run the Analysis:

Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Ensure the dataset (Customer Churn.csv) is in the working directory.

Execute the code step-by-step to replicate the results and visualizations.

3. Explore the Dataset:

Key Columns:

gender, SeniorCitizen: Customer demographics.

tenure: Length of customer relationship.

Contract: Contract type (month-to-month, one year, two years).

PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges: Financial details.

Churn: The target variable indicating if the customer left the service.

üîß Tools and Techniques

This project leverages:

Python Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation.

numpy for numerical operations.

matplotlib and seaborn for advanced visualizations.

Techniques:

Data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, encoding).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and anomalies.

üéØ Recommendations for Business

1. Focus on Retention Strategies

Design rewards for long-term contracts to encourage loyalty.

Offer discounts or incentives for customers who commit to annual or biennial plans.


2. Address Payment Pain Points

Transition customers from electronic checks to automated payments or credit cards.

Simplify the payment experience to enhance customer satisfaction.


3. Bundle Services

Promote bundled offerings of OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, and StreamingTV, as customers using these services churn less.


4. Senior Citizen Retention

Create tailored plans or perks for senior citizens to reduce churn in this demographic.


5. Engage New Customers

Implement proactive engagement strategies for customers in their first three months, as churn is highest during this period.
